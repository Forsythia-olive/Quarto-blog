    "text": "Introduction\nAs we grow older, our health needs evolve in ways that profoundly impact our quality of life. Imagine if we could leverage data to predict these changes, leading to more personalized and effective public health programs. This analysis explores whether health data can distinguish between adults (under 65) and seniors (65+), offering insights into how we might improve public health initiatives for aging populations.\nThe dataset used to answer this question is the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2013-2014 (NHANES) Age Prediction Subset (NHANES (2019)). It was originally prepared for a research paper on predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease in patients (Dinh and Miertschin (2016) and Mukhtar and Al Azwari (2021)). The dataset’s stated purpose was to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States (Papazafiropoulou (2024)), however respondents were classified as either Adults (respondents under 65 years of age) or Seniors (respondents 65 years of age or older). Respondents were located in the United States and provided data through interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). While the dataset has been used in previous research on diabetes and cardiovascular disease, this analysis focuses specifically on age prediction. By examining patterns in health data, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of machine learning models for classifying age groups and identify potential avenues for improving public health strategies.\nThis analysis focuses on predictive modeling, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and model performance metrics like precision and recall. While we concentrate on age classification, exploring the factors most predictive of age lies outside the scope of this study. By narrowing our focus, we aim to provide actionable insights that inform future work in age-related health analytics."

    "text": "Methods & Results\n\nData Sources\nThis dataset was sourced from the [NHANES], a large-scale public health initiative that collects health and nutritional data from a representative sample of adults and seniors in the U.S. Data were collected through a combination of clinical measurements and self-reported surveys between [years]. The dataset contains information on demographic, physical activity, and metabolic health factors.\n\n\nConducting EDA on the training set\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngender\nphysical_activity\nbmi\nblood_glucose\ndiabetic\noral\nblood_insulin\n\n\n\n\ncount\n1775\n1775\n1775\n1775\n1775\n1775\n1775\n\n\nmean\n1.51\n1.82\n27.78\n99.11\n1.99\n113.89\n11.66\n\n\nstd\n0.5\n0.38\n7.15\n17.08\n0.1\n45.79\n9.54\n\n\nmin\n1\n1\n14.5\n63\n1\n40\n1.02\n\n\n25%\n1\n2\n22.7\n91\n2\n87\n5.8\n\n\n50%\n2\n2\n26.7\n97\n2\n104\n8.89\n\n\n75%\n2\n2\n31.1\n103\n2\n129\n14.26\n\n\nmax\n2\n2\n70.1\n405\n2\n604\n102.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training data has 1775 observations. Since gender, physical_activity, and diabetic features were categorical, only the mean and standard deviation from the table above were relevant for those columns. Body mass index values below 18 are considered underweight, and values over 40 are considered severely obese. We observed that the middle 50% of values fall between 22.7 & 31.1, though the max was 70.1, which is concerningly high. Blood glucose, oral, and blood insulin have their own ranges, so it was necessary to standardize these variables before fitting our model.\n\n\nVisualization for EDA\nThe distributions in Figure 1 below show class imbalance, with very few seniors relative to adults in our dataset. Across numeric variables, mode values for seniors were less pronounced than they were for adults, though ranges seemed similar. Seniors seemed to have higher oral values and lower blood insulin values than adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Feature Distributions by Age Group (groups are not stacked)\n\n\n\n\n\nPreprocessing Steps\nTo prepare the data for analysis, we applied several cleaning and transformation steps:\nColumn Renaming: Variable names were updated to be descriptive (e.g., ‘RIDAGEYR’ → ‘Age’) for clarity.\nInvalid Values: Observations with undocumented values in ‘physical_activity’ and ‘diabetic’ were removed to ensure consistency with the dataset’s metadata.\nOne-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables (e.g., gender, physical_activity) were converted into binary indicators to enable their use in machine learning models.\nStandardization: Numeric variables (e.g., BMI, blood glucose) were standardized to ensure comparability across features with different scales.\n\n\nAnalytical Approach\nWe tested three models to classify respondents as adults or seniors based on health and nutrition data:\nDummy Classifier: A baseline model predicting the majority class.\nLogistic Regression: Selected for its simplicity, interpretability, and alignment with healthcare applications.\nSupport Vector Classifier (SVC): Included to explore the potential of non-linear relationships in improving classification.\nPerformance was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-PR, chosen for their ability to assess model performance in imbalanced datasets.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Mean cross validation scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\ntest_score\ntrain_score\n\n\n\n\n0\nDummy\n0.847887\n0.847887\n\n\n1\nLogistic\n0.696338\n0.706056\n\n\n2\nSVC\n0.676056\n0.703521\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Best Model on Test Data\nSince logistic regression had the best mean cross validation score, we selected it as our final model.\nThe model’s accuracy on test data was 0.725.\n\n\nTools\nThe following software packages were used in this project: Chorev et al. (2022), Harris et al. (2020), Bantilan (2020), Pedregosa et al. (2011), The pandas development team (n.d.), VanderPlas et al. (2018), Van Rossum and Drake (2024)."

    "text": "Discussion\n\nSummary of Findings:\nOur analysis sought to determine whether health and nutritional data could be used to predict whether individuals are adults (under 65) or seniors (65+). The results showed that age group prediction is feasible with moderate accuracy (~73.0%), but significant room for improvement remains. The initial high accuracy was largely due to class imbalance, with the model heavily favoring adults, the majority class. This highlighted the need for balanced metrics like F1 score to better evaluate the model’s performance.\n\n\nImplications:\nThese findings indicate that predictive models can be a valuable tool for identifying age-related health patterns, which could inform public health strategies. However, the model’s current limitations—particularly its difficulty in identifying seniors—underscore the need for further refinement before it can be used in practice.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nImproving Data Handling: Address outliers in features like “physical_activity” and “diabetic” with deeper investigation rather than outright removal. Expand EDA to include pairwise correlations and feature importance analysis to reduce redundancy and engineer meaningful features.\n\nModel Enhancement: Incorporate hyperparameter tuning (e.g., tuning C in Logistic Regression) and use class weighting to address imbalance. Shift focus to metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure balanced performance.\n\nAlternative Modeling Approaches: Explore non-linear models, such as random forests, to capture potential interactions between health and nutritional factors that Logistic Regression may miss.\n\nFuture Research: Investigate the most predictive health and nutritional factors for age classification. This could lead to actionable insights for tailoring public health programs to specific age groups.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Future Work:\nThe analysis faced several limitations, including oversimplified data cleaning and limited feature exploration during EDA. Logistic Regression, while interpretable, may not fully capture the complexity of age-related health patterns. Future work should focus on deeper feature analysis, advanced modeling techniques, hyper parameter tuning and incorporating a broader range of health and demographic variables.\n\n\nConclusion:\nData science is inherently iterative, and this analysis represents a step toward leveraging health data for age classification. By addressing the outlined limitations and exploring more advanced methods, we can better understand age-related health needs and design interventions that improve health outcomes for aging populations."
